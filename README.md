**A puzzle solver of a problem "where to move in" to stay in touch with friends.**

*You have 9 friends, who live in 9 houses within a one straight street. Lengths of particular houses counting from the left beginning of the street are like below:*

+ A — 1.1 km
+ B — 2.3 km
+ C — 3.0 km
+ D — 4.2 km
+ E — 5.1 km
+ F — 6.3 km
+ G — 13.4 km
+ H — 19.1 km
+ I — 27.5 km

*On which particular kilometre on the street (counting from the left) you would hire a flat, to minimize the sum of the lengths to all your friends, who live on the same street?
In other words: find the point X, for which function:
dist(A,X) + dist(B,X) + … + dist(I,X)
gives smallest value.*
